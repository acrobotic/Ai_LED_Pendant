Overview
---
This repository includes our libraries for [CadSoft EAGLE PCB Design Software][1] (version 6.x). We use the components in these libraries for designing the electronic hardware of the products we sell on our [website][2]. We've tested most of the footprints herein, and little by little we'll be adding whether they've been tested or not in the devices' description. Nonetheless, always, **always** test your board layouts by printing a 1:1 scale copy, and superimposing the physical components on it. 

If you find a mistake (wrong-sized footprints, mislabeled pins) [let us know][4] and receive a **10% discount** on your next order! 

For clearly explained, step-by-step tutorials on using these libraries for designing your own electronic hardware please visit our [learning resources site][3].

Library Organization
---
We've arranged the components into libraries according to their function to try and facilitate searching for each one of them.  Some organizational choices are a matter of preference whereas others might have been done by mistake.  If you spot something that could be done better please [let us know][4].

1. **Ai_Boards**: development boards (e.g., Blackjack) and their respective shields (e.g., Arduino Motor Shield, Blackjack Wi-Fi Shield)
2. **Ai_Connectors**: all types of connectors such as USB, pin headers and sockets in different configurations (e.g., pad shapes, with or without silkscreen), SD cards, screw terminals, etc.
3. **Ai_DiscreteSemis**: diodes and transistors.
4. **Ai_Electromechanical**: mechanical hardware (e.g., stand-offs), buttons, switches, etc. 
5. **Ai_FrequencyControl**: crystals, resonators, etc.
6. **Ai_IC**: digital and analog Integrated Circuits such as microcontrollers, digital logic chips, shift registers, etc. (Excludes power ICs such as regulators, and RF ICs such as Wi-Fi and Bluetooth modules)
7. **Ai_LED**: LEDs of all shapes, sizes, and colors.
8. **Ai_Miscellany**: frames, logos, and other non-electrical/-mechanical items.
9. **Ai_Passives**: capacitors, inductors, resistors, fuses, beads, potentiometers, etc.
10. **Ai_Power**: power ICs such as regulators, power symbols (e.g., GND, 5V, VIN, VBAT).
11. **Ai_RF**: RF ICs including Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, RF connectors, antennas, etc.

Usage
---
To use these libraries please follow these simple steps:

1. Download this repository, and make a note of its location in your system.
2. Open the EAGLE application, and select the `Control Panel` window.
3. Using the top menu, select `Options` Â» `Directories`.
4. The `Directories` window lets us specify the location of the libraries, scripts, design rules, and other components of EAGLE's software.  In the first line we see an entry for `Libraries` to which we want to **append** the location of the downloaded contents (`Ai_EAGLE_Libraries`).
  
  4.1. **Option 1**: assuming that the `Ai_EAGLE_Libraries` repository was downloaded to the current user's home directory, simply change the text entry `$EAGLEDIR/lbr` to:
    
    `$EAGLEDIR/lbr:$HOME/Ai_EAGLE_Libraries (for OS X and Linux)`
  
  or,
  
    `$EAGLEDIR\lbr;$HOME\Ai_EAGLE_Libraries (for Windows)`

  _**Note**: The_ `$HOME` _part of the location specifies the home folder of the current user, thus these examples assume that the libraries were downloaded to that location location (C:\Users\YourUsername (Windows), /Users/YourUsername (OS X), /home/YourUserName (Linux))._
  
  4.2 **Option 2**: if we want the `Ai_EAGLE_Libraries` residing with other custom libraries inside a `custom_libraries` directory we can choose the path:
    
  `$EAGLEDIR/lbr:$HOME/custom_libraries (for OS X and Linux)`
  
  or,
  
  `$EAGLEDIR\lbr;$HOME\custom_libraries (for Windows)`

5. Click `OK` to save your changes. If the directory doesn't exist EAGLE will ask to create one.  

  If the Ai_EAGLE_Libraries folder **already exists** in your system and you get this prompt then select `No`, go back to step 2., click on the option 'Choose' at the bottom right of the window, and select the location manually.  

  If the Ai_EAGLE_Libraries folder **doesn't exist**, then select `Yes`. Afterward you'll need to move the downloaded `Ai_EAGLE_Libraries` folder into the newly created location.

6. As of EAGLE 6.5.0 you should be able at this point to see the `Ai_EAGLE_Libraries` by selecting the `Control Panel` window, and expanding (clicking on `+`) the `Libraries` option.

7. To browse our components, expand the `Ai_EAGLE_Libraries` option and subsequently expand any of the libraries therein (e.g., `Ai_Boards`, `Ai_Connectors`, etc.).

If you have any doubts about installation, usage, or troubleshooting the library and/or CadSoft's EAGLE software check out our [PCB Design tutorials and guides][3].
